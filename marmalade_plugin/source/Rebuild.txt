Instructions for source maintentance:

	* The extension is built on top of the IABHelper and other classes written by Google.
		* These have had to modified significantly to make the usage pattern more ameanable to Marmalade plus numerous bugs have been fixed - so replace carefully.
		* If updating to a newer version of the store, convert the new aidl (service interface definition file) into a java file by adding it to an Eclipse project then  copy the autogenerated /gen version into the extension.
